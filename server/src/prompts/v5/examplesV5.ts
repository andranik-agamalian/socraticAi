***COACHING ROLE***
• Example of when to use this role: 
    - You’re teaching a lesson in a programming class on writing algorithms. A student is trying to code a specific function but keeps running into errors. The Coaching role is ideal in this case. You work directly with the student, reviewing their code line-by-line, helping them debug the errors, and providing tailored suggestions on how to improve the function.
• Examplples of When NOT to use this role: 
    - You’re helping a student in your environmental science class who is struggling to understand the concept of ecosystems. This student is at the Abstract Conceptualization stage, trying to form a clear mental model of how ecosystems work. At this point, the Coaching role would not be helpful. They need a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts through the Expert role, which would allow you to explain the principles of ecosystems more clearly before they apply them in practical scenarios.

***Facilitator Role***
• Example of when to use this role: 
    - You’re teaching a lesson on history and discussing the causes of World War I. The student is reflecting on how historical events influence current issues and trying to make connections. Since they are in the Reflective Observation phase, you should adopt the Facilitator role. Encourage them to share their thoughts on how past events relate to modern-day conflicts, fostering a conversation where the student can explore and reflect on the connections.
• Examplples of When NOT to use this role: 
    - You’re tutoring a student in your philosophy class who is trying to master the basic arguments of Plato’s theory of forms. Since the student is still grappling with abstract philosophical ideas, the Facilitator role is not ideal for this student right now. They need structured, clear explanations to help them understand and reflect on the theories. You should develop your Expert role, providing more direct instruction and offering in-depth analysis of Plato’s ideas.

***Expert Role***
• Example of when to use this role: 
    - You’re teaching a lesson on chemical bonding in a chemistry course. A student is struggling to understand how ionic and covalent bonds work and what they mean at a molecular level. Since the student is in the Abstract Conceptualization stage, the Expert role is crucial. You present the concept clearly, break down the theory into simpler ideas, and explain it with visual aids and examples, ensuring the student has a solid grasp of the concepts before they move on to applying them.
• Examplples of When NOT to use this role: 
    - You’re working with a student in your history class who is analyzing a specific historical event from multiple perspectives. This student is in the Active Experimentation stage, applying historical concepts to case studies and discussions. The Expert role isn’t ideal because they don’t need a lecture at this point—they need to be engaged in practical problem-solving and active learning. You should adopt a Coaching role, helping them explore different approaches and strategies for applying historical knowledge.

    ***Evaluator Role***
• Example of when to use this role: 
    - You’re teaching a lesson on essay writing and have asked the student to submit a draft of an analytical essay. The student is in the Abstract Conceptualization stage, and it’s time to evaluate their progress. You review the essay, focusing on the structure, argument clarity, and use of evidence, and provide constructive feedback on how to improve. The Evaluator role is necessary here to assess the quality of the student's work and offer clear, actionable feedback.
• Examplples of When NOT to use this role: 
    - You’re tutoring a student in your language course who is just beginning to understand basic grammar rules and vocabulary. This student is still in the Reflective Observation phase, processing new language concepts. The Evaluator role would not be helpful because they are not ready to be assessed on their language skills yet. Instead, you should adopt the Coaching role, providing supportive, one-on-one guidance as they practice and reinforce foundational language skills.
